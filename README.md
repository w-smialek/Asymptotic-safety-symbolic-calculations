# Landau Pole in the Standard Model and the Asymptotic Safety

Calculations in the Functional Renormalization Group determining the gravitational contibution to the
running of abelian gauge coupling in the Standard Model and the fate of the Landau Pole in a theory with Standard Model suplemented by an asymptotically safe quantum gravity.

All the theoretical introduction and explanation is available in the work, available as pdf.

The Mathematica code uses the xAct library for the tensor algebra and field theoretic symbolic computation.

The reference is a section 2.2 of the work.

Calculation of a critical value of gravitational contribution to the abelian gauge beta function, below which the theory would be asymptotically free. The rough assumption of neglecting the running of gravitational coupling is made and the calculations may serve as a starting point for studying the Landau Pole + gravity problem.

Validation of the Functional Renormalization Group implementation on the scalar $\phi^4$ theory. In itself, using FRG for $\phi^4$ looks like an overkill, but the method is very elegant, as we explicitly obtain a differential equation determining the running of coupling.
